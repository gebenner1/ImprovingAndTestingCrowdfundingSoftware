### CIS 5730 Project

This repository was the baseline software we recieved for the project.

Our goal for the course project for CIS 5730 Software Engineering was to both improve the software, and write many tests to make sure errors were fixed and exceptions were handled properly.

Please see https://github.com/ajfinky/573project/ for our updated code and additional tests.
